      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Catherine studies at the Kellogg School of Management, where she plans to major in Health Enterprise Management and Marketing Management. She lives downtown with her husband, Damien, and her cat, Boots. Before Kellogg, she was an HIV research specialist in Washington, DC. She is a native Californian, but moved to the District after college and also had a quick stint in Vermont. She is enjoying life on the third coast, and hopes to find a position in Chicago at a health startup this summer.
