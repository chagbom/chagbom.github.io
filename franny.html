    <h2>Childcare from the ones who care!</h2>

      <h4>Pitch</h4>
      <p>
        An app that allows users to leverage their networks to find temporary childcare
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>Now that caregiving services have gone online, finding a sitter is easier than ever. However, finding a new sitter requires trust-building, which takes time. What do parents do when there is an urgent need for a sitter and their regular care is not available?
		</p>
		<h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>Leverage your FRanny network</p>
        <p>We are much more comfortable leaving our children with people we know, or people we know of through people we know
		</p>
		<section>
      <h4>Market</h4>
        <p>Parent with a somewhat urgent need for a sitter

      <section>
      <h4>Monetization</h4>

        <li>targeted advertising</li>
        <li>retailer kickbacks</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Value Add</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Quickly identify a potential Franny – problem solved</li>
		<li>Conveniently thank and “pay” sitters via linked retailers (Paying loved ones is awkward)</li>
